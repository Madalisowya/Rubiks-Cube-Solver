for all of the faces of the cube, the following operations are defined:
(note that green is the front face, and white is the top face)
R : 90 degree clockwise rotation of red face
L : 90 degree clockwise rotation of orange face
U : 90 degree clockwise rotation of white face
D : 90 degree clockwise rotation of yellow face
F : 90 degree clockwise rotation of green face
B : 90 degree clockwise rotation of blue face

For the double turn moves (e.g. R2), the move R is performed twice.
if a move is followed by an apostrophe (e.g. R'), the move R is performed counter-clockwise.
